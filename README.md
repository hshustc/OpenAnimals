**OpenAnimals** is a flexible repository that aims to help researchers get started on **Animal Re-Identificatoin** quickly. 
This repository is built upon [FastReID](https://github.com/JDAI-CV/fast-reid) and [WildlifeDatasets](https://github.com/WildlifeDatasets/wildlife-datasets).


## Installation

Please refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Usage

1. Please refer to [README.md](datasets/README.md) for preparing the datasets.
2. Please refer to [run_animals.sh](run_animals.sh) for training and validation.
